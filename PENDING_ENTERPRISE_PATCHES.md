## Pending Changes Queue for Future Enterprise Patch

### [2026-10-29] feat(silo): complete air-gap isolation between v1-stable and enterprise beta
- **Commit**: `f8f6f48`
- **Files Changed**:
  - `server.ts`
  - `src/lib/firebase.ts`
  - `src/lib/updateRoomAnnotation.ts`
  - `src/services/arenaConfigService.ts`
- **Summary**:
  - Implemented runtime domain detection (`IS_ENTERPRISE_BETA`), query filtering, and write boundaries across campaigns, uploadedAssets, monsters, allies, characters, mapZones, arenaConfig, and activeSession.
  - Added strict deletion barriers: Beta cannot delete non-beta assets/campaigns/monsters, and Stable cannot delete Beta documents.
  - Configured server-level static upload recovery filtering by service domain.
- **Impact / Testing Notes**:
  - Verify that Beta operates using the seeded `beta_` document namespace without affecting any Stable production records.
